                    During my internship at Axendo (Procura), a finance and procurement company in Dubai, I had the opportunity to work on various marketing assignments. These assignments aimed to provide insights into the critical importance of viewer retention in expanding our client base and to underscore the significance of procurement within the company.

    Furthermore, I delved into the IT implementation known as Logiswift and its role in enhancing our procurement processes. Logiswift allowed us to track our progress, enabling us to pinpoint areas requiring assistance within the organization promptly. This ensured that we didn't duplicate efforts with the same clients and enabled us to stay on top of deadlines.
