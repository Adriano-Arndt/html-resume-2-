                    <p>
                        During my internship at Axendo (Procura), a finance and procurement company in Dubai, I had the opportunity to work on various marketing assignments. These assignments aimed to provide insights into the critical importance of viewer retention in expanding our client base and to underscore the significance of procurement within the company.

                    <p> 
                        Furthermore, I delved into the IT implementation known as Logiswift and its role in enhancing our procurement processes. Logiswift allowed us to track our progress, enabling us to pinpoint areas requiring assistance within the organization promptly. This ensured that we didn't duplicate efforts with the same clients and enabled us to stay on top of deadlines.

                    <b>Internship Student (Arndt Medienzentrum)</b>
                     <p>
                     During my internship, I collaborated closely with the CEO to explore strategies for boosting the company's total revenue. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the business and its operations, the CEO took me on a tour of the Oberhavel district in Berlin, where I had the opportunity to meet with clients and gain insights into the company's foundational processes.

                     <p>
                        Throughout my internship with Mr. Marius, I conducted interviews with him to delve deeper into his vision for the company and the specific positive impacts he aimed to achieve. For instance, we discussed the targeted percentage increase in sales that he sought to implement. This allowed me to align my efforts with his goals and work towards a shared vision for the company's growth.
